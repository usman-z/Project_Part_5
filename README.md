### Instructions to Start the web application
- The AngularJS frontend can be started using the "ng serve" command once you cd into the AngularJS directory and use the “npm install” command to download all the necessary dependencies to serve the frontend on http://localhost:4200/
- The ExpressJS backend can be started using the "node app.js" command once you cd into the ExpressJS and use the “npm install” command to download all the necessary dependencies to serve the backend on http://localhost:8080/
- The application uses XAMPP for the database, so for the application to run the XAMPP SQL server must be running on http://localhost:3306/
